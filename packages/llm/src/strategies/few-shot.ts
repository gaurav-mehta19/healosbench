Doctor: Hi Jenna, what brings you in today?
Patient: I've had a sore throat for about four days, and now my nose is completely stuffed up. I feel awful.
Doctor: Any cough?
Patient: A little dry one at night.
Doctor: Fever?
Patient: I felt warm yesterday. The thermometer here said 100.4.
Doctor: Let me take a look. Throat is red but no exudate, ears are clear, lungs sound fine. Rapid strep is negative. This looks like a viral upper respiratory infection.
Patient: Can I get an antibiotic just in case?
Doctor: Antibiotics won't help a virus, and they'd just give you side effects. Let's do supportive care. Take ibuprofen 400 mg every 6 hours as needed for the throat pain and fever, plenty of fluids, and saline nasal spray. If you're not improving in 7 days, or you spike a fever above 102, give us a call.
Patient: Okay, that makes sense.
Doctor: No need for a follow-up unless symptoms worsen.`;

Doctor: Good morning, Daniel. What's going on?
Patient: I've had this pressure behind my eyes and cheeks for like ten days. It started as a cold but now it's just bad pressure and yellow-green stuff coming out my nose.
Doctor: Any fever?
Patient: On and off. Today it was 101.
Doctor: Tooth pain when you lean forward?
Patient: Yeah, especially in my upper teeth.
Doctor: Tenderness over your maxillary sinuses, that's where I'm pressing. Yes, those are tender. Given the duration past 10 days with worsening symptoms, this looks like acute bacterial sinusitis. I'm going to start you on amoxicillin-clavulanate 875 mg twice daily for 7 days. Use a saline rinse twice a day, and you can take pseudoephedrine 30 mg every 6 hours for the congestion if it doesn't keep you awake.
Patient: Got it.
Doctor: If you're not significantly better in 5 days, call us. Otherwise no follow-up needed.`;

const FEW_SHOT_SYSTEM = `You are a clinical data extraction assistant. Given a doctor-patient encounter transcript, extract structured clinical information using the extract_clinical_data tool.

Rules:
- Extract ONLY information explicitly stated in the transcript. Do not infer or hallucinate values.
- If a vital sign is not mentioned, set it to null.
- Medication route defaults to "PO" (oral) unless otherwise specified.
- ICD-10 codes are optional; include only if you are confident.
- Plan items should be concise and discrete (one action per item).

Here are two annotated examples showing the expected extraction quality:

=== EXAMPLE 1 ===
TRANSCRIPT:
${EXAMPLE_1_TRANSCRIPT}

EXTRACTION:
${EXAMPLE_1_OUTPUT}

=== EXAMPLE 2 ===
TRANSCRIPT:
${EXAMPLE_2_TRANSCRIPT}

EXTRACTION:

Now extract from the transcript provided by the user. Follow the same format and detail level as the examples.`;
